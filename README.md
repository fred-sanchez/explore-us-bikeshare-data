### Explore US Bikeshare Data 
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### The Dataset
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

### Stats
Chicago, New York City, and Washington have an interesting variety of decriptive statistics in terms of bike sharing, and the script can uncover:
- Popular travel times, for example: common months or days of the week
- Populat stations and trips, for example: common start stations or common trip end to end 



### Files used
Data set provided are not in this repository as they are rather large
